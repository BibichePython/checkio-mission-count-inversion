    In computer science and discrete mathematics,
    an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(discrete_mathematics)">inversion</a>
    is a pair of places of a sequence where the elements on these places are out of their natural order.
    So if we use ascending order for numbers,
    then a inversion is when bigger number appear before lower number in a sequence.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at example. sequence = (1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6) and we can see here three inversion:<br>
    - 5 and 3;
    - 5 and 4;
    - 7 and 6.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a sequence of unique numbers and you should count inversion in this sequence.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A sequence as a tuple of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The inversion number as an integer.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
count_inversion((1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6)) == 3
count_inversion((0, 1, 2, 3)) == 0
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    In this mission you will work with nested loops, of course if you don't use advanced algorithms.
</p>

    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    2 &lt; len(sequence) &lt; 200<br>
    len(sequence) == len(set(sequence))<br>
    all(-100 &lt; x &lt; 100 for x in sequence)
